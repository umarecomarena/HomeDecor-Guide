  <h1>My Honest Home Decor Journey: Budget-Friendly Tips That Actually Work! 🏡</h1>
</header>

<div class="container">
  <p>Hi everyone! 👋 I wanted to share my home decor journey with you because, let’s be real, decorating your home can feel super overwhelming—especially when you’re on a budget.</p>

  <p>I didn’t want to spend thousands just to make my space look cute and cozy. So I started researching cheap home decor ideas and doing little DIYs, and honestly, I’m surprised at how much you can transform your home without spending a lot.</p>

  <p>If you’re looking for easy home decor ideas, budget-friendly home styling, or a quick living room makeover, I hope this post helps you out. Let’s dive in!</p>

  <div class="tip">
    <h2>1. Start with a Vision Board</h2>
    <p>Use <a href="https://www.pinterest.com/pin/558587160029715024/" target="_blank">Pinterest</a> to figure out what you like—boho, modern, farmhouse, etc. Creating a vision board helped me stay focused and avoid impulse buys. 🎯</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h2>2. Declutter First</h2>
    <p>It’s not the fun part, but it made the biggest difference. My apartment felt bigger and brighter after donating and removing what I didn’t love.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h2>3. Thrift Stores Are Gold Mines</h2>
    <p>I found a $10 vintage mirror and ceramic vases—just add a coat of spray paint or a fresh frame for a designer look on a dime.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h2>4. Easy DIY Decor Ideas</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Mason jar wall sconces with fairy lights</li>
      <li>Framed fabric or wallpaper as art</li>
      <li>Peel-and-stick wallpaper for backsplashes</li>
      <li>Painted terracotta pots for indoor plants</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Materials from <a href="https://amazon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Amazon</a> and kept it all budget-friendly.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h2>5. Add Greenery (Fake or Real!)</h2>
    <p>Snake plants, pothos, peace lilies, and a few fake plants made my space feel more alive. 🌿</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h2>6. Rugs = Instant Transformation</h2>
    <p>One of the best things I bought was a shaggy area rug for my living room. It instantly made the space look warm and pulled together. Rugs are like magic—seriously. Look for affordable rugs online or try sites like <a href="https://shaggyrugsuk.co.uk/">Shaggy Rugs</a> and Land of Rugs.
Tip: Measure your space before buying. I learned that the hard way. 😅

  <div class="tip">
    <h2>7. Lighting Makes All the Difference</h2>
    <p>Softer bulbs, floor lamps, and string lights made my apartment cozier and more welcoming. 💡</p>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h2>8. Small Bedroom Design Hacks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Use mirrors to reflect light</li>
      <li>Store items under the bed</li>
      <li>Choose light bedding colors</li>
      <li>Use a floating shelf instead of a nightstand</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="tip">
    <h2>9. Don’t Ignore the Bathroom</h2>
    <p>I used to ignore my bathroom completely, but a few simple touches made a big difference. I swapped out my shower curtain, added a small rug, and used matching dispensers for soap and lotion.
I also used peel-and-stick tiles to cover up the old floor. It was SO easy, and it made the bathroom look brand new. Try searching for “easy bathroom decor ideas” or “budget bathroom makeover” to get started.

  <div class="tip">
    <h2>10. Add Personality with Art and Photos</h2>
    <p>You don’t need expensive art. I printed out some of my favorite travel photos and framed them. I also got some cute prints on <a href="https://www.art.com/" target="_blank">art gallery</a> for less than $5 each.
Mix personal items with new decor and your home will instantly feel more you.
